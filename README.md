# Hi, I'm Zaroxqs or Joshua üëç

## About Me
I'm currently planning on getting a degree in software development. I started coding at 8 years old, and since then have tried a ton of different languages.

### Languages:
- **HTML**: My first attempt at coding, at first I gave up on it before picking it up again a few years later
- **Lua**: Learned it for creating games on Roblox and started making some text based games with it as well
- **Python**: I learned a little bit of Python before shifting my attention back to HTML
- **HTML & CSS**: This time I properly learned how to make sites which was definitely worth it
- **JavaScript**: I'm planning to learn more JS in the future, but I've learned a little bit of JS for web development.

### Web Development:
- I experimented with free website hosts and domains to get some experience
- Making websites was a lot of fun and trying out new things was really rewarding

### The C# Experience
- C# was how I for the first time started makings apps
- Probably the most enjoyable aspect of coding for me was learning C#; I tried to build every app concept I had and got better at it in the process

## Right Now
- I wish to gain more experience and a professional background in coding
- I have a cat
