# Hi, I'm Zaroxqs or Joshua üëç

## About Me
I'm currently planning on getting a degree in software development. I started coding at 8 years old, and since then have tried a ton of different languages.

### Languages:
- **HTML & CSS**: My first attempt at coding, which I at first gave up on before picking it up again a few years later. Currently decently provicient with.
- **Lua**: Learned it as a kid for creating games on Roblox and made some text based games with it as well.
- **Python**: Not very experienced with python but I can find my way around.
- **JavaScript**: I'm planning to learn more JS in the future. Currently only have basic understanding of it for web development.
- **C#**: My current programming language of choice. I enjoy using C# a lot for app development and game development.

## Right Now
- I wish to gain more experience and a professional background in coding
